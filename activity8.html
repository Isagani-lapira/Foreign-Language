            <p id="description"><span> Get</span>a partner from your classmates. Watch the video "How to Order at Mc Donald's" on our FL 301 Class Site.  . Based on this video and UNIT 3 lessons that you have learned, do your virtual conversation. 
                Be sure to record your conversation using screen recording (or using any video recording features depending on the app that you prefer to use). 
                One of you will act as the CUSTOMER and the other one will be the Mc Donald's CREW. Practice your dialogues several times to master the correct pronunciation before having your recorded conversation. </p>
